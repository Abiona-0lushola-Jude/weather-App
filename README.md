### Useful resources

-  resource 1 (https:rapidapi.com/hub) - This helped me for documentation steps, which makes it easier for me to create. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
-  resource 2 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcSTeotmJtw) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand how to make FETCH requests from APIs. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
